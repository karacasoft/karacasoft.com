          <h1>Seriously, What Do You Do?</h1>
          <p>I've been into programming for like 6 years. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at
          Bogazici University. In that time span, I worked with what my heart desired most.
          Here's a list of what I have experience with, together with estimated times that 
          I worked with that specific area about software:</p>
          <ul class="areas-expert">
          </ul>
          
          <p>Here's a list of also what I have experience with, but contents of this list
            include the things that I have much less experience with:</p>
          <ul class="areas-not-expert">
          </ul>
          
          <p>You can also click on these items to see useless stories about
          how I began writing in that specific area. Or things that are even more 
          useless.</p>

          <p>Here's (yet) another list of what I have done so far.</p>
