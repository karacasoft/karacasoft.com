          <h1>Seriously, What Do You Do?</h1>
          <p>I am currently studying Computer Engineering at
          Bogazici University. And I've been developing software for
          (maybe) 6 years.
          In that time span, I worked with what my heart desired most.
          Here's a list of what I have experience with, together with estimated times that 
          I worked with that specific area about software:</p>
          <ul class="areas-expert down-arrow">
            <li>
              <span class="area-name">Android</span>
              <span class="area-experience">Experience: 3 years</span>
              <p class="area-description">I've worked with Android from 2013 to
                2015. I've had small hobby projects though but Android has
                changed significantly, and I think I have lost my proficiency
                in Android.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="area-name">Visual Basic 6.0</span>
              <span class="area-experience">Experience: 1 year, this doesn't
                really matter though since no one uses VB6.0 anyways :V</span>
              <p class="area-description">My first love! I've started my
                programming adventures with VB6.0. I still remember how easy
                it was to setup a form and quickly define some actions on
                buttons. Back then, programming was editing the code until it
                works. Although I've had lots of brilliant(?) ideas, the
                software design was not too brilliant. My persistence was the
                key for me to open other gates of the software world. I once
                debugged one of my simple games for a month to seek out one
                single line that broke the whole game!!</p>

              <span class="area-name">HTML/CSS/JS</span>
              <span class="area-experience">Experience: A lot</span>
              <p class="area-description">Every programmer should have basic
                knowledge of this triplet. My story of how I met them is
                different for each one of them. So I'll keep things simple
                and say that I've been working with these since when I
                started programming, until today where I build this website.
                (With some help of jQuery though :V)</p>

            <li>
              <span class="area-name">PHP</span>
              <span class="area-experience">Experience: 2 years (at least)</span>
              <p class="area-description">I remember wondering how websites
                with login features were built. With some research and prior
                knowledge of scripting I've learned PHP. In high-school my
                mates asked me to find a website where we can store photos
                that we will select for our yearbook. And then, I, like every
                sane person would do, decided to build it by myself. Very
                few people used my site to store the photos. But it was a
                great experience for me in PHP. Also the reaction of my
                friends were priceless when I said I have built a site,
                instead of finding one.</p>

            <li>
              <span class="area-name">Java</span>
              <span class="area-experience">Experience: A lot more than
                Android</span>
              <p class="area-description">I've learned Java by learning
                Android. (Yes, I never learned Java before Android) It
                was kinda painful, though. The great thing was, I've started
                learning the concepts of object oriented programming
                by examining the example Android code from different
                people. Since I've worked with it a lot, I'm very
                comfortable to write any kind of application with Java.
                (Frameworks kinda scare me, though) When I want to have
                some proof of concept for some application idea, I
                immediately open Eclipse and start designing it. I've
                written a Tetris game with Java Swing Library. And my
                last internship was about writing an application with
                JavaFX, which makes use of Java 8 lambda functions a lot.

            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Here's a list of also what I have experience with, but contents of this list
            include the things that I have much less experience with:</p>

                <p class="area-description">I've not written applications in C/C++. But used it in some everyday(!) cases
                  like developing an operating system or writing Android Native codes with JNI

                <p class="area-description">This is my latest trend I think. One day, I decided to build my own operating
                  system. (Just like every sane person would think, right?) After fiddling around
                  with x86 assembly codes for 3 days, I've managed to make a bootable USB drive
                  that boots into a system that prints the text "Hello World!" on screen. Later
                  that, I've managed to build more complex version of it (which can take keyboard
                  inputs). Have the project on <a href="https://github.com/triforce930/KaOS">github</a>,
                  please have a look!</p>

                <p class="area-description">Arduino was a fascinating thing for me at first. The maker inside me was awakened,
                  after seeing how Arduino can be used to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywfZsYApj_M">this</a>.
                  Later, I bought one and worked with it for some time. Then bought some different

              <p class="project-description">Caps Yapıcı was the leading application to generate memes that were becoming
                increasingly popular in Turkey. Caps Yapıcı was the first application that
                attempted to generate memes with red stripe and white text on it, which were
                really popular in Turkey. Caps Yapıcı was also my very first Android application
                that I've released. After a lot of reworks and fixes, (The application was
                full of bugs/crashes), the application climbed up to 500k downloads, which
                I was never thinking of. At 250k downloads I've sold the application which
                is probably the reason why I should never touch business related stuff in my
                life, later on.</p>

              <p class="project-description">Asteroid Rush was the very first game I've developed for Android. It had a very
                simple objective with complex controls, and was too repetitive. Later versions
                of it had online scoreboards but I took the game down, due to a copyright infringement
                notice from Atari who said it creates customer confusion(!). I took the game
                down, and shared its source code on GitHub. (With a different name, of course!)</p>

              <p class="project-description">This was my first attempt to create a Cardboard application. When the Cardboard
                was released, there was no video player (to my knowledge) that displayed 3D
                HSBS videos using 3D effects of the Cardboard. So I decided to build it myself.
                Learned how OpenGL 2.0 works along the way. Now, there are superior versions
                of VR video players, though mine sits there humbly waiting for its take down.
                PS: The old version of the application is on GitHub.</p>

              <p class="project-description">The name comes from our CMPE course. In the course we were given the task of
                building a Tetris game. They've given us a graphics library which was dependent
                on Java Swing library. I didn't like that, and built my game directly on Swing,
                using a custom component to draw on. I was new to the Tetris in that times,
                so I've built my own rotation system, included hard drop, unlimited lock delay
                while you move the pieces, hold, 1-piece preview, and increasing difficulty
                and local multiplayer. Also had a very simple AI which was part of the assignment
                as bonus.</p>

              <p class="project-description">My operating system project. The name comes from my last name (Karaca OS). Also
                means 'chaos' in Turkish language. I dream of having releases with version
                names like: KaOS:Revenge, KaOS:Anarchy, which resembles chaotic things. This
                is actually a project to learn about how operating systems are developed, I
                don't really expect someting big coming from this. I like building my own components
                of software and sticking them together, so I actually enjoy building components
                of this project.</p>

              <p class="project-description">This came from the Video Player for Cardboard application Using pure OpenGL was
                not the best for designing UI's so I decided to build a UI framework to work
                with it faster. The framework works fine, but in Unity, there are a lot better
                tools to work for better UI's, so I left the project in the middle. The current
                version was used on the Video Player for Cardboard though.</p>

              <p class="project-description">This is my first hardware project. It's basically a glove with gyro sensors on
                it. It tracks the movements and transfers it to a computer via bluetooth.</p>

          <h1>So what will you do now?</h1>
          <p>I have absolutely no idea. I mostly do what I want to
          do in that specific time. Currently, I want to finish my OS
          project. But in the meantime, I can switch to working on the
          GyroHand project. The thing is, I develop software because it's
          fun. If developing software start being boring to me, I'll
          switch to something else for a while and probably return back
          to developing more software.</p>

          <p>Maybe? Send me an e-mail, or message, or ... I don't know.
          I go to meetups and developer conferences. Maybe some day, we 
          can meet in one of them.</p>
